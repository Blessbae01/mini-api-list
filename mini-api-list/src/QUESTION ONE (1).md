SECTION C
An insurance company, AXA Mansard in Nigeria, aims to enhance its cash flow forecasting by improving the prediction of patient charges. They want to achieve this by utilizing demographic data and basic patient health-risk metrics recorded at the time of hospitalization. The goal is to develop a deep learning model and create a web application where users can input a patient's demographic and health information into a web-based form, which will then generate an estimated charge amount. Using the dataset provided in Table 2, address the following questions in 7 and 8.

QUESTION SEVEN (7)
a) Describe the deep learning architecture you would use to predict patient charges based on the demographic and health-risk metrics. Explain your choice of model and its components.
(4 Marks)

b) Write a section of the Python script to define, compile, and fit your architecture in 7(a).
